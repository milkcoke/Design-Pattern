# Design Pattern
This repository is for studying design pattern and practicing with java source code.

## Create Pattern
| Pattern Name     | 	Description                                                                                                                 | Done | 
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Singleton        | 	The singleton pattern restricts the initialization of a class to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created. |      |
| Factory	         | The factory pattern takes out the responsibility of instantiating a object from the class to a Factory class.                |      |
| Abstract Factory | Allows us to create a Factory for factory classes.                                                                           |  ✅   |
| Builder	         | Creating an object step by step and a method to finally get the object instance.                                             | ✅    |
| Prototype	       | Creating a new object instance from another similar instance and then modify according to our requirements.                  |      |

## Structure Pattern
| Pattern Name | 	Description                                                                                                                                     | Done |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Adapter      | 	Provides an interface between two unrelated entities so that they can work together.                                                            | ✅    |
| Composite    | 	Used when we have to implement a part-whole hierarchy. For example, a diagram made of other pieces such as circle, square, triangle, etc.       |      |
| Proxy        | 	Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.                                                                  | ✅    |
| Flyweight    | 	Caching and reusing object instances, used with immutable objects. For example, string pool.                                                    |      |
| Facade       | 	Creating a wrapper interfaces on top of existing interfaces to help client applications.                                                        |      |
| Bridge       | 	The bridge design pattern is used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client program. |      |
| Decorator	   | The decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime.                                                        | ✅    |

## Behavior Pattern
| Pattern Name	           | Description                                                                                                                                      | Done |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Template Method         | 	Used to create a template method stub and defer some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.                                          ||
| Mediator	               | Used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.                                                        ||
| Chain of Responsibility | 	Used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.              | ✅    |
| Observer	               | Useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.                                  |      |
| Strategy	               | Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime. |      |
| Command	                | Command Pattern is used to implement lose coupling in a request-response model.                                                                  | ✅    |
| State	                  | State design pattern is used when an Object change it’s behavior based on it’s internal state.                                                   | ✅    |
| Visitor	                | Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.                                              |      |
| Interpreter             | Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.                                       |      |
| Iterator	               | Used to provide a standard way to traverse through a group of Objects.                                                                           |      |
| Memento	                | The memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on.                                  |      |
